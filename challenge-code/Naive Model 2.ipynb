    "Currently, the simulation check says that there is time travelling going on. However, this is a false alarm. The simulation thinks that as we read the events in the order of cumulative list(these are ordered as they are received. Basically, this order should be the same as the order of the dataset). However, beaucase incidents are prioritised in accordance to their priority, there is small chance that an incident with a lower urn but higher priority is done first. The simulation thinks that this is proof of time travelling. However, this isn't how we should be checking for time travelling.\n",

    "Update: Added a list called resolved_incident to simulation that keeps a track of when something was assigned to a person (essentailly). Hence, it becomes easier to check for time travelling on this list instead of cumulative list. The logic of the check_simulation function was not changed."
