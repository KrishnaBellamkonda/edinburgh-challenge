## üìò Overview
This repository documents the analytical framework and simulation models developed during my **Research / Data Science Internship** with **Police Scotland (2024)**.  
The project focused on modelling **spatio-temporal crime patterns** and optimising **resource allocation** through quantitative simulation and statistical methods.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Build a scalable simulation of **police operations in West Scotland**, capturing five years of incident-demand dynamics.  
- Develop a **quantitative optimisation model** for station location and resource distribution.  
- Design a **multi-factor prioritisation metric** integrating spatial, temporal, and socio-economic variables.  
- Provide data-driven insights to support long-term strategic planning and infrastructure modernisation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- Implemented a **Python-based simulation framework** for large-scale operational modelling.  
- Designed an **optimisation model** demonstrating that:
  - **25% fewer stations** can maintain current efficiency.  
  - A restructured model (‚Äì50% legacy / +25% modern sites) yields **profitability after 8 years**.  
- Applied **geospatial clustering, Monte Carlo methods**, and **temporal demand prediction** to optimise response strategies.  
- Developed a **multi-factor ranking system** combining location, demand intensity, and infrastructure age for resource prioritisation.  
- Research outcomes are under consideration for **peer-reviewed publication** in quantitative public-sector modelling.
